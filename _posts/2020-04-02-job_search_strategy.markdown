Let's start with some numbers: I officially graduated from the Flatiron School Part-Time Online Software Engineering Program on January 29. I started sending out applications on February 12. I received my first offer letter on March 12, and my second offer letter on March 17. I embarked on my job search journey having heard from several successful software engineers that it takes an average of three months to land your first programming job. Every time I thought about this it made me cringe, so I was totally determined to distill the job search period down as much as possible.

In addition to the well-established things you should be doing during your job search period, namely:
* drill algorithms & data structures using tools like HackerRank & LeetCode
* continue learning/building on technologies taught by Flatiron using resources like Udemy & Pluralsight
* continue implementing/applying your skillset by solving problems with custom applications -- even better if you can team up with other developers or grads
* practice technical interviewing using online tools, mock interviews with developer friends/mentors, whiteboarding/coding without a compiler
* really craft/finesse your unique story, and pratice telling it
* networking -- I am not a networking master, so I relied heavily on Flatiron’s Career Prep literature on how to network. Notably, they offer an abundance of information on *online networking*. Their suggestions are challenging and demanding so you have to really put in meaningful effort that will ultimately pay off.
* blogging: conveys ongoing learning
* git commits: conveys ongoing skill application
* be thoughtful and genuine when communicating with anyone and everyone
* prioritize your job search as much as possible -- the outcome is 100% dependent upon your input

I took what felt like a brute force approach at the onset of my search, but with hindsight have tried to characterize my "strategy": 
### Cast a wide net.

1. Apply for jobs on LinkedIn.
  * Ignore the parts about years of experience and technical skill requirements (it’s nothing more than the employer’s wish list). As long as you see something that aligns, even if it is just one language or technology, apply. Don’t be picky! Until your schedule is packed with interviews, do not limit what you apply for, because any interest that you get is valuable and much-needed practice.
  * Whether you apply on LinkedIn or the posting takes you to another site to complete the application, please always write a cover letter. If your resume/experience is lacking, which it definitely is if you’re looking to land your first coding job, the cover letter is your chance to capture the recruiter’s attention. Flex your very best writing skills.
  * There will be a lull with respect to hearing from recruiters/ hiring managers. You can safely assume that the folks that are in charge of selecting applicants have a million other things to do so getting a response about a job you applied for can take days, weeks, or even months! All the more reason to cast that net super wide.
  * You will get many “rejection emails”. Don’t sweat it. Knowing that someone did actually consider your application and took the time to inform you of a decision is pretty cool. 
2. Seize the opportunities facilitated by Flatiron.
  * Knowing that you are competing with other Flatiron grads, present yourself in the best way possible, and come up with a unique way to set yourself apart. 
    * For example, when I was getting ready for a Flatiron Campus Recruiting Event, I thought about the fact that all of the interviewees would have school portfolio projects that would be pretty similar to mine. So leading into the speed dating-style event I focused all my effort on putting together a new, custom app to be able to present to the interviewers, which effectively impressed every company I interviewed with!
3. Look in unexpected places.
*   Some startups post ads on Craigslist! I was actively interviewing with a startup I found on Craigslist up until I informed them that I ended up accepting an offer from a different company, but they were an amazing group of people and I was really grateful to be in consideration.
*   Governmentjobs.com -- I had an extremely rewarding interviewing experience for an incredible job I found here that actually resulted in my first offer!
4. Respond to interest from companies ASAP. If you get an invitation to complete a coding challenge, drop everything and get to work on it. If a recruiter wants to schedule a phone interview, try to get on their calendar that same week ASAP. At the early stages of your job search, always respond affirmatively and complete the actions requested.
5. Prioritize prospects. Number four will begin to shift once you start accumulating interest and scheduling second and third interviews. You will start to feel overwhelmed by interviews and things prospective employers are asking of you. Work very hard to continue to impress your prospects. If it feels like an especially exhausting full-time job, you’re doing it right. Only when you reach advanced stages of interview processes should you start prioritizing focus. Keep as many prospects as possible going strong for as long as you can. While it’s true that you only need one “yes”, or one offer, you should really be shooting for more than one.

And no matter what, **be confident**!
